/* The following code implements a basic queue with insert and delete operations.The implementation uses
three variables, "front" , "rear" and "count", to keep track of the front of the queue, the rear of the queue
and the number of elements in the queue respectively.Since this is a linear queue implemented using an array,
where the front is incremented after each deletion, the queue eventually runs out of usable space. Mitigating
this problem here would require expensive copy and swap operations which has not been done here. Instead, the
user is given a choice to reinitialize the queue in such a situation.*/
